I am happy to release my new open source project **TwiPodcast**. Actually, I built this project for one of my best friend who lives in India.

We usually have a regular chat on Facebook and wishing her **Good Morning** and **Good Night** everyday had become my daily routine. One day, I thought, why not wish her everyday in my own voice via phone call. So, to wish her, I can use Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp or Viber as there are so many VOIP alternatives. But all these options require active internet connection both to sender side and receiver side. If it was one day task, I could call from my phone or use those free VOIP apps but I need to wish her everyday and it is going to cost me a lot if I continue with existing call options.

As a developer, I thought why not build something myself that can be used to call phones for free. This is how the idea for the project comes in my mind. Initially this project was made specifically for my friend but then I realized, there might be many people like me, who wants to wish their beloved ones in their own voice for so, I generalized the project for normal people.

Though, the initial idea was to wish my friend but after working on the project for some days, the idea changed from wishing to listening podcast and so named TwiPodcast as there are many people who love listening podcast.

## What is TwiPodcast

Twipodcast is a web app that allows you to listen podcast or any mp3 media file on your phone for free without internet.

Yes, you heard it right. You donâ€™t need internet to listen podcast.

## How it works?

The web app uses the url of the mp3 file and calls the given phone number to stream the mp3 file directly to the phone number via phone call without requiring internet to the receiver side. You can supply a valid url of any media file that is of mp3 format to stream the media file to your phone without internet.

## Use cases

### Listening podcast

Suppose, you want to listen any podcast on your mobile phone. To listen it, you must have internet connection and you know, it is going to eat your data package if you are on mobile network.

### Convert text to speech
