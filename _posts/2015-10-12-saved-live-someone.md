*Donating my O+ve blood to Uma Devi Neupane at Nepal Redcross Society Regional Blood Transfusion Center, Biratnagar, Nepal*

Today, I saved life of a woman named **Uma Devi Neupane** by donating my O+ve blood to her. She was admitted in Nobel Hospital, Biratnagar for Uterus operation and she needed blood for the successfull operation. I felt very great to donate my blood.
