Few days back I was going through my Facebook news feed and suddenly my eyes strike on one of the post of my friend.
He had just changed his profile picture. One thing I saw different in his profile picture was that the color of our national flag was overlapped on the picture with transparency. The profile picture looked good. 😛 😛
and then I went through the comments of that post and there I saw him mentioning that if there could be any app to make the task of applying flag color on profile picture with ease. As I am learning Java, I thought to make the app. This way I could practice my Java skill as well and then started developing the app.
Finally today I have completed developing the app.

This is a desktop app. You can run this app in any platform: Windows, Linux or Mac.
Note: You must have Java JRE plugin installed to run this app.
Your suggestions are always welcome.

The project is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/sandipbgt/nepal-flag-color-embedder](https://github.com/sandipbgt/nepal-flag-color-embedder)
