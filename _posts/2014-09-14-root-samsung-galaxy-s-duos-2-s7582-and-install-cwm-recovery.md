Samsung Galaxy S Duos 2 S7582 is a second version of previous Galaxy S Duos. It comes with a 4.0 inches display, 5 megapixel camera, a 768 MB RAM and with a good dual core 1.2 GHz processor. Okay, that was little bit description about device feature. Now let’s proceed towards the actual thing.

Actually there are two methods for rooting your S Duos 2. Though, I have discussed both of these methods here, I went with the method One but method Two is also safe.

### Method One:
In this method, first we are going to install Clockworkmod (CWM) recovery and then install root files from CWM recovery screen.

#### Preparing:
1. Download and install USB drivers for your S7582 to your computer from [here](http://www.mediafire.com/download/uw3z23dqz3y7kgn/Samsung-Usb-Driver-v1.5.45.0.exe)
2. Download and install latest version of Odin 3.07 from [here](https://db.tt/6TeW9pN7)
3. Download root files to your computer from [here](https://db.tt/WfuSB205)
4. Download CWM recovery files for Galaxy S Duos 2 s7582 from [here](https://db.tt/4d8X5Teb)

**Note:** Please download all the files mentioned above before going to next step.

#### Executing:
**Note:** Make sure, you have already installed Samsung USB drivers.

1. Connect your phone as MTP and copy on Phone memory the file **UPDATE-SuperSU-v1.34.zip** (without unzipping it).
2. Unplug the USB cable.
3. Turn off your your phone
4. Press and hold **Volume DOWN + Home + Power** until you can read a Warning screen and press **Volume UP** to continue.
5. Connect your phone to PC and wait for the drivers to be installed

12. Release only **Power button** and you will be on CWM Recovery Mode.
