For anyone who is learning `React Native`, the starting point is [the official tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html). You must have gone through it and now have a better idea 
of what React Native is all about.

You have no idea about where to go from here, though.

If you do a Google search, you will get lots of tutorials and blogs on seemingly any topic relating to React Native. But they also use lots of fancy words that you might not understand if you are just starting out or some might be too easy for you depending upon your level of experience. What most of these tutorials lack is the targeted audience. A beginner who is just starting to learn might get lost if you start talking about `React Navigation`, or `Redux` or `Axios`. What he expect is using the default set of libraries provided by react native to build something that can help him gain experience.

So, in this tutorial, we will build a project from scratch from the perspective of a person with little knowledge of React Native. We will progress step by step and gradually add more features to our app with the intention of learning by doing.

The project we will be building is named `GithubAPIExampleRN`. This project will help you learn all the basics of React Native from beginner to advance level. This app allows you to type a Github username and list all his repos. In other to make our task easy we will use Github API. The API is public and doesn't need authentication.

So assuming you have followed basic tutorial of React Native from official site, let's start.

We will build a very basic version of this app first and slowly we will update it and make it advance.

Create a new project by typing the below commands in terminal
{% highlight bash %}
react-native init GithubAPIExampleRN
{% endhighlight %}

![Creating new react native project]({{ site.url }}/img/posts/2018-08-06-react-native-github-api-example-from-beginner-to-advance/1.png)

Now lets go inside our project directory and start the project
{% highlight bash %}
cd GithubAPIExampleRN
react-native run-android
{% endhighlight %}

If everything is working properly, let's get our hands dirty.

Open `App.js` inside our project directory and replace all the code with the following. Don't worry, I will explain each and everything as we progress.

{% highlight bash %}
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  View,
  TextInput,
  Dimensions,
  TouchableOpacity,
  Alert,
  ScrollView
} from 'react-native';

const screenWidth = Dimensions.get('window').width;

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.label}>GitHub Username</Text>
        <TextInput
          placeholder="Enter your github username"
          style={styles.input}
        />
        <TouchableOpacity
          style={styles.button}
          activeOpacity={0.8}
          >
          <Text style={styles.buttonText}>VIEW</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#FFFFFF',
  },
  label: {
    fontSize: 16,
    marginBottom: 6,
  },
  input: {
    width: screenWidth - 20,
    height: 38,
    padding: 4,
    fontSize: 16,
    borderColor: '#3a3a3a',
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderRadius: 8,
  },
  button: {
    height: 45,
    flexDirection: 'row',
    backgroundColor:'#263238',
    borderColor: '#263238',
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderRadius: 8,
    marginBottom: 10,
    marginTop: 10,
    alignSelf: 'stretch',
    justifyContent: 'center'
  },
  buttonText: {
    color: '#FFFFFF',
    fontSize: 18,
    alignSelf: 'center',
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

Letâ€™s go through the code step-by-step:
* First we imported required modules and some extra modules which we will use later in our code.
* Second we defined the component that represents the UI.
* Third we created a style object that controls the component's layout and appearance.

The main part to consider is `render()` function inside the `App` class. Here we are returning a `View` component which contains three child components.

The `Text` component is used to display text. Here, we are using it to display label for our form.

The `TextInput` component is used to get input from user. In our app, we need to allow user to fetch repos by entering Github username. So, we have used this component.

The `TouchableOpacity` component is used to create a button to submit the form. Inside, there is another `Text` component which is used to display the label for the button.

We have applied styles to all our component using the `style` property of the respective component to get a nice looking UI.


Save your changes to **App.js** and return to the emulator. Double tap **R** on your keyboard, and you'll see your app starting to take shape:

You can skip having to refresh the app by enabling live reload feature. Press `Cmd+M` fr MAC or `Ctrl+M` for Windows/Linux in the emulator, then select **Enable Live Reload:**

So far, we have completed the UI of our app. Now, let's add functionality to it so that it can be useful.

First add state object inside `App` component before `render()` function and add some default properties to it.

{% highlight bash %}
state = {
  username: '',
  repos: [],
}
{% endhighlight %}

Add new function `_handleChange` after state object. This function is used to sync the value of `username` property of state object with the value entered in `TextInput` component.
{% highlight bash %}
_handleChange = (evt) => {
  this.setState({
    username: evt.nativeEvent.text
  });
}
{% endhighlight %}

Add `onChange` property to `TextInput` component. This property allows us to link our `_handleChange` function to `onChange` event of `TextInput`
{% highlight bash %}
<TextInput
  placeholder="Enter your github username"
  style={styles.input}
  onChange={this._handleChange}
/>
{% endhighlight %}

Add new function `_getUserRepos` after `_handleChange` function. This function will call the `Github` API and get the list of repos for a given user in json format.
{% highlight bash %}
_getUserRepos = (username) => {
  username = username.toLowerCase().trim();
  const url = `https://api.github.com/users/${username}/repos`;
  return fetch(url).then((res) => res.json());
}
{% endhighlight %}

Add new function `_handleSubmit` after `_getUserRepos`. This function is used to handle the button. When the user clicks on **VIEW** button, this function will call `_getUserRepos` function and when response is received, it will update our `state` object.
{% highlight bash %}
_handleSubmit = () => {
  this._getUserRepos(this.state.username)
    .then((res) => {
      this.setState({repos: res});
    });
}
{% endhighlight %}

Add `onPress` property to `TouchableOpacity` component. This property allows us to link our `_handleSubmit` function to `onPress` event of `TouchableOpacity`
{% highlight bash %}
<TouchableOpacity
  style={styles.button}
  activeOpacity={0.8}
  onPress={this._handleSubmit}>
  <Text style={styles.buttonText}>VIEW</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
{% endhighlight %}

So far everything is in place but if you type your github username and click on **VIEW** button, nothing will happen. We don't have any way to display the response received from Github API.

Add new function `_renderRepos` after `_handleSubmit` function. This function is responsible for rendering repos list. We are using a `ScrollView` component and inside it, we are looping through the repos state and displaying the repo name in `View` component. 
{% highlight bash %}
_renderRepos = () => {
  return (
    <ScrollView>
      {
        this.state.repos.map((repo, i) => {
          return (
            <View key={i}>
              <Text>{i}, {JSON.stringify(repo.full_name)}</Text>
            </View>
          )
        })
      }
    </ScrollView>
  )
}
{% endhighlight %}

Add `{ this._renderRepos() }` after `TouchableOpactity` button component in render function of `App` component. Here's the updated code.
{% highlight bash %}
render() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.label}>GitHub Username</Text>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Enter your github username"
        style={styles.input}
        onChange={this._handleChange}
        value={this.state.username}
      />
      <TouchableOpacity
        style={styles.button}
        activeOpacity={0.8}
        onPress={this._handleSubmit}>
        <Text style={styles.buttonText}>VIEW</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>
      
      { this._renderRepos() }

    </View>
  );
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, type your Github username in the `Github Username` field and click on `VIEW` button. Your github repos will be listed below the button and since, we have used `ScrollView` component you can also scroll the list if the list is longer.

This concludes our basic app. In next post, we will use `FlatList` component for better performance.
